# ScriptingComponents
Unity components for basic gameplay scripting

originally inspired by events and actions in unreal engine 3's kismet

event components are called by built-in unity events(OnTriggerEnter), your custom events, delegates or however you want to do it

events 'activate' action components that do small discrete tasks, like enabling a light, spawning an object, playing sounds and particles, etc

this has lots of half implemented actions and events because this collection was built during Questria and included lots of specific part of that game

TODO list is on its way!
